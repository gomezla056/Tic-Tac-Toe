# Tic-Tac-Toe

A game of 2-player tic-tac-toe that uses exception handling when inputting a value other than an integer for row and column. Other than that, the game is played as usual.

The users choose their names to display on the screen. Whoever sets their name first goes first. As for the board, we have the following:

```
   0   1   2
0    |   |
  ---|---|---
1    |   |
  ---|---|---
2    |   |
```

The numbers nearby the board indicate the row and column number. Row numbers are on the left side where column numbers are on the top side.

The game will continue until one of the users wins the game or the game will result in a draw.
